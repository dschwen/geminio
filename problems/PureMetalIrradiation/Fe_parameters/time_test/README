Fe_cp1.i 
  reference time usage including all necessary kerenels
  time cost: 16 hrs
Fe_cp2.i
  goal: test cost of diffusion kernels  (remove diffusion kernel)
  time cost: 16 hrs
Fe_cp3.i
  goal: test cost of spatial dependent production sources  (use spatially constant sources)
  time cost: 16 hrs
Fe_cp4.i
  goal: test cost of functions in GGroup (_emit(), _disl(), _diff()) 

**Summary: 1. spatial dependent production sources and diffusion kernel don't addition noticeable computation cost
           2. guess: GGroup costs most of the time
